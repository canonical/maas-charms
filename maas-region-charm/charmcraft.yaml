description: |
  MAAS runs a software-defined data centre - it turns a collection of physical
  servers and switches into a bare metal cloud with full open source IP address
  management (IPAM) and instant provisioning on demand.

  The MAAS region controller (maas-regiond) is the REST API server for
  all MAAS clients, and the postgres database that maintains machine
  state for the entire data centre (or “region”). The region controller
  an be scaled-out and highly available given the appropriate postgres
  setup and additional API servers.
