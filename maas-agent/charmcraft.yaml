description: |
  The MAAS agent (previously maas-rackd) provides highly available, fast
  and local broadcast services to the machines provisioned by MAAS. You
  need a MAAS Agent attached to each fabric (which is a set of trunked
  switches). You can attach multiple agents to these physical networks
  for high availability, with secondary agents automatically stepping to
  provide these services if the primary agent fails.
